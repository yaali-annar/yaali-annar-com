Phonemically, the pharyngealization is a feature of a vowel. Phonetically, the consonant behind the vowels gets pharyngealized. Consider the pair:

- <hoŝ'ib> /xoɬˤib/ (something green)
- <hoŝb'i> /xoɬbˤi/ (green)

Further, the velar consonants turns into uvular before the pharyngealizing vowels.

- <ŧok'ol> [θoqol] (something heavy)
- <ŧokl'o> [θoklˤo] (heavy)

After a vowel or at the beginning of a word, emphatic becomes a voiced pharygeal fricative:

Consider following roots:

- <ra'al> /ɹaʕal/
- <'aral> /ʕaɹal/

Lastly, a schwa might appear between two consonants at a syllable boundary if:

- The consonant ends with a voiced plosive, or
- Both of the consonants are /θ s ɬ ç/
