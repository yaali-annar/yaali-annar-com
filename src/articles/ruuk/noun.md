The noun cases are in form of postpositions.

Core cases:

| Case     | Morpheme |
| -------- | -------- |
| Ergative | ak       |
| Patient  | il       |
| Genitive | iš       |

Spatial cases:

| Case     | Morpheme |
| -------- | -------- |
| Locative | ot       |
| Allative | ar       |
| Ablative | tik      |

Other cases

| Case         | Morpheme |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Causative    | gat      |
| Benefactive  | sat      |
| Instrumental | us       |
| Commitative  | m'ah     |

As stated in the morpheme section, four of these (Ergative, Patient, Locative, Instrumental) can be used to modify the meaning of a content word.

### Spatial

Spatial nouns are used to convey more specific direction or location, such as "into" or "under". Some of the spatial nouns are.

| Position | Noun   |
| -------- | ------ |
| Top      | h'alaš |
| Botton   | k'u'uh |
| Inside   | dahol  |
| Outside  | harog  |
| Front    | riših  |
| Back     | panod  |

For example, the preposition "after" and "before" is convered with "at the back of" and "at the front of" even when it's used as temporal marker.

```gloss
Kakkla panod ot kalob ušun
@k-akkla panod ot kalob ušun
@ABS-eat back LOC dog sleep
The dog sleeps after eating.
```

### Genitives

By default two nouns put together are connected in attributive manner. That is to say, they behave as if there's a genitive between them.

- kalob kakla > A dog's food.

This extends to three or more nouns put together.

- kalob kakla kakakos > A dog's food bowl.

There's no ambiguity in ruuk. The attribution is resolved from left to right. So `kalob kakla kakakos` is parsed as `(kalob kakla) kakakos` (a bowl of dog food) instead of `kalob (kakla kakakos)`. The genitive marker `iš` is used to change the default resolution order:

- kalob iš kakla kakakos > The food bowl of a dog.

### Pronouns

There's no number distinction in pronouns, just like in nouns.

| Pronoun       | Morpheme |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 1st           | niin     |
| 2nd           | kook     |
| 3rd Proximal  | ŧuuk     |
| 3rd Distal    | šuuk     |
| Reflexive     | fiis     |
| Interrogative | maan     |

Like nouns, the pronouns can have numeral or quantifier with them.

- ŧiin nin > the two of us
- sašad kok > many of you

All the nouns can be turned into modifier, in particular the 3rd person and interrogative can be used as a determiner.

- uŧuk kalob > this dog
- aman kalon > what kind of dog
