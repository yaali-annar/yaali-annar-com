## Part of Speech

Ruuk language has a three-way distinction between nouns, verbs, and modifiers. By default, the root form of a word is a noun. A root must have:

- Two vowels.
- A consonant at the beginning and the end.

The default form of the root is a noun. Adjectives and modifiers are derived from it through metathesis. The verb form switches the first two phonemes, while the modifier form switches the last two phonemes. For example:

| Noun              | Modifier        | Verb               |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| mauğ (good thing) | magu (good)     | amuğ (be good)     |
| tiok (sleeper)    | tiko (sleeping) | itok (sleep)       |
| puup (dog)        | pupu (doggy)    | upup (to be a dog) |

The abstract form of the noun is formed by adding the first consonant to the verb form.

- mamuğ > goodness
- titok > sleep (as a noun)
- pupup > the state of being a dog

### Alignment

Ruuk is an ergative language with a verb-last syntax.

```gloss
Puup itok
@puup itok
@dog sleep
The dog sleeps
```

The postposition "ak" is the ergative case marker.

```gloss
Puup ak śuan an'aś
@puup ak śuan an'aś
@dog ERG water drink
The dog drinks water
```

All intransitive verbs in spoken loti are labile verbs (also called ergative verbs). Adding an ergative turns the verb into a causative.

```gloss
Śo'ih as'it
@Śo'ih as'it
@ice melt
The ice melts
```

```gloss
Nuup ak śo'ih as'it
@nuup ak śo'ih as'it
@fire ERG ice melt
The fire melts the ice
```

By default, the noun form of a root indicates either the **core argument of an intransitive verb** or the **object of a transitive verb**.

| Word  | Valence      | Meaning                                |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| puup  | intransitive | dog                                    |
| tuur  | intransitive | things that move                       |
| na'aś | transitive   | things that are consumed (food, drink) |

### Alignment Morphemes

The alignment morphemes can become postposition or infix. They are:

| Morpheme             | Case |
| -------------------- | ---- |
| Actor, Ergative      | ak   |
| Patient, Antipassive | il   |
| Locative             | ot   |

Some morphemes are postposition only however:

| Morpheme         | Case |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Genitive         | ar   |
| Dative, Allative | ap   |
| Ablative         | uð   |

The **actor morpheme** shifts the root noun into the **causer of an originally intransitive verb** or **the agent of a transitive verb**.

| Word    | Meaning                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| puakuv  | someone that turns other people into dogs      |
| tuakur  | things that move (other things)                |
| naak'aś | things that consume (consumer, eater, drinker) |

As usual, the verb form is derived by switching the first consonant and vowel.

| Word    | Meaning                  |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| upakuv  | to turn someone into dog |
| utakur  | to move something        |
| anak'aś | to consume (as an actor) |

In the antipassive voice, while the noun with an absolute case (null morpheme) becomes the actor of a transitive verb, the patient of a verb, if needed, is marked with a **patient case "il'**.

```gloss
Śuan il puup anak'aś
@śuan il puup an<ak>'aś
@water PAT dog drink<ACT>
The dog drinks water
```

While -il- can be used as an infix, it has the same meaning in intransitive verbs and is usually only used for emphasis.

- anil'aś = an'aś > food, drink, fuel.

The locative -ot is similar to the preposition in, at.

```gloss
Puup ak do'uþ ot an'aś
@puup ak do'uþ ot an'aś
@dog ERG house LOC eat
The dog eats at home
```

As a verb modifier it turns the noun in absolute case into location of the verb.

```gloss
Puup ak do'uþ an<ot>'aś
@puup ak do'uþ an<ot>'aś
@dog ERG house eat<LOC>
The dog eats at home
```

As a noun, the infix means something where the verb is done.

- naot'aś > place to eat

# Modality

The second infix in a root determines modality and/or evidentiality.

| Infix | Meaning                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| k'u   | ability or possibility (can, may) |
| sa    | necessity (must)                  |

It acts like verbal mood.

```gloss
Puup ak lauh ank'u'as
@puup ak lauh an<k'u>'as
@dog ERG milk drink<BIL>
The dog can drink milk
```

Likewise, the infix can be used in noun as well.

- puk'uup > someone who can be a dog.
- pusauv > someone who must be a dog (someone who is definitely a dog).

And the infix can be put together with the voices.

- puilk'uup > someone who can be turned into a dog
