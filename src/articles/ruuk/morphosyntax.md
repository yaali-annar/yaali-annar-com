## Part of Speech

Ruuk language has a three-way distinction between nouns, verbs, and modifiers. By default, the root form of a word is a noun. A root must have:

- Two vowels.
- A consonant at the beginning and the end.

It may have a consonant in the middle.

The default form of the root is a noun. Adjectives and modifiers are derived from it through metathesis. The verb form switches the first two phonemes, while the modifier form switches the last two phonemes. For example:

| Noun               | Modifier        | Verb                |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| t'aab (good thing) | t'aba (good)    | 'atab (be good)     |
| šuun (sleeper)     | šunu (sleeping) | ušun (sleep)        |
| kalob (dog)        | kalbo (doggy)   | aklob (to be a dog) |

The abstract form of the noun is formed by adding the first consonant to the verb form.

- t'atab > goodness
- šušun > sleep (as a noun)
- kaklob > the state of being a dog

By default, the noun form of a root indicates either the **core argument of an intransitive verb** or the **object of a transitive verb**.

| Word  | Valence      | Meaning                                |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| puup  | intransitive | dog                                    |
| tuur  | intransitive | things that move                       |
| na'aś | transitive   | things that are consumed (food, drink) |

### Alignment

Ruuk is an ergative language with a verb-last syntax.

```gloss
Kalob ušun
@kalob ušun
@dog sleep
The dog sleeps
```

The postposition "ak" is the ergative case marker.

```gloss
Kalob ak maik akkal
@kalob ak maik akkal
@dog ERG water consume
The dog drinks water
```

All intransitive verbs in spoken loti are labile verbs (also called ergative verbs). Adding an ergative turns the verb into a causative.

```gloss
S'abar aŧub
@Ssabar aŧub
@ice melt
The ice melts
```

```gloss
Lahab ak s'abar aŧub
@lahab ak s'abar aŧub
@fire ERG ice melt
The fire melts the ice
```

Likewise, without the ergative noun, the sentence is similar to passive voice.

```gloss
Maik akkal
@maik akkal
@water consume
The water is drunk
```

Causative on transitive noun is formed by the causative postposition "gat"

```glos
nin gat kalob ak maar akkal
```

### Alignment Morphemes

The alignment morphemes can become postposition or infix. They are:

| Morpheme              | Case |
| --------------------- | ---- |
| Ergative, Antipassive | ak   |
| Patient               | il   |
| Locative              | ot   |
| Instrumental          | us   |

The **antipassove morpheme** shifts the root noun into the **causer of an originally intransitive verb** or **the agent of a transitive verb**.

| Word    | Meaning                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| kalakob | someone that turns other people into dogs      |
| halakak | things that move (other things)                |
| kakakal | things that consume (consumer, eater, drinker) |

The verb form is derived by switching the first consonant and vowel.

| Word    | Meaning                  |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| aklakon | to turn someone into dog |
| ahlakak | to move something        |
| akkakal | to consume (as an actor) |

In the antipassive voice, while the noun with an absolute case (null morpheme) becomes the actor of a transitive verb, the patient of a verb, if needed, is marked with a **patient case 'il'**.

```gloss
Maik il kalob akkakal
@maik il kalob akk<ak>al
@water PAT dog drink<ACT>
The dog drinks water
```

While -il- can be used as an infix, it has the same meaning in transitive verbs and is usually only used for emphasis.

- kakilal = kakal > food, drink, fuel.

The locative -ot is similar to the preposition in, at.

```gloss
Kalob ak bait ot akkal
@kalob ak bait ot akkal
@dog ERG house LOC eat
The dog eats at home
```

As a verb modifier it turns the noun in absolute case into location of the verb.

```gloss
Kalob ak bait akkotal
@kalob ak bait ak<ot>al
@dog ERG house eat<LOC>
The dog eats at home
```

As a noun, the infix means something where the verb is done.

- kakotal > place to eat

# Modality

The second infix in a root determines modality and/or evidentiality.

| Infix | Meaning                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| t'u   | ability or possibility (can, may) |
| gu    | necessity (must, need)            |

It acts like verbal mood.

```gloss
Kalob ak h'alib akt'ukal
@puup ak lauh ak<t'u>kal
@dog ERG milk drink<BIL>
The dog can drink milk
```

Likewise, the infix can be used in noun as well.

- kat'ulob > someone who can be a dog.
- kagulob > someone who must be a dog (someone who is definitely a dog).

And the infix can be put together with the voices.

- kat'ulilob > someone who can be turned into a dog
