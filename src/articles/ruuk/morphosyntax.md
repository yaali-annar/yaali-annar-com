Ruuk language has a three-way distinction between nouns, verbs, and modifiers. By default, the root form of a word is a noun. A root must have:

- Two vowels.
- A consonant at the beginning and the end.

The default form of the root is a noun. Adjectives and modifiers are derived from it through metathesis. The verb form switches the first two phonemes, while the modifier form switches the last two phonemes. For example:

| Noun               | Modifier        | Verb               |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| so'ot (good thing) | sot'o (good)    | os'ot (be good)    |
| riam (sleeper)     | rima (sleeping) | iram (sleep)       |
| puuv (dog)         | pubu (doggy)    | upuv (to be a dog) |

# Alignment

Ruuk is an ergative language with a verb-last syntax.

```gloss
Puuv iram
@puuv iram
@dog sleep
The dog sleeps
```

The postposition "ak/ek" is the ergative case marker.

```gloss
Puuv ek la'an ul'ul
@puuv ek la'an ul'ul
@dog ERG water drink
The dog drinks water
```

All intransitive verbs in spoken loti are labile verbs (also called ergative verbs). Adding an ergative turns the verb into a causative.

```gloss
Haah at'oh
@haah at'oh
@ice melt
The ice melts
```

```gloss
Geit ek haah at'oh
@geit ek haah at'oh
@fire ERG ice melt
The fire melts the ice
```

# Voices

By default, the noun form of a root indicates either the **core argument of an intransitive verb** or the **object of a transitive verb**.

| Word   | Valence      | Meaning                                |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| k'a'as | intransitive | things that move                       |
| lu'ul  | transitive   | things that are consumed (food, drink) |

There are several morphemes that can modify a word when infixed or act as a case marker when used as a postposition. The first one is -ek / -ak.

The **actor morpheme** shifts the root noun into the **causer of an originally intransitive verb** or **the agent of a transitive verb**.

| Word       | Valence      | Meaning                                        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| k'a(ak)'as | intransitive | things that move (other things)                |
| lu(ek)'ul  | transitive   | things that consume (consumer, eater, drinker) |

This can even be used for concrete nouns:

- puuv > pu(eh)uv : someone that turns other people into dogs

As usual, the verb form is derived by switching the first consonant and vowel.

- 'ak'as > 'ak(ak)'as: move something
- ul'ul > ul(ek)'ul: to consume (as an actor)

In the actor voice, while the noun with an absolute (null) case becomes the actor of a transitive verb, the patient of a verb, if needed, is marked with a **patient case "il'**.

```gloss
La'an il puuv ulek'ul
@la'an il puuv ul(ek)'ul
@water PAT dog drink(ACT)
The dog drinks water
```

While -il- can be used as an infix, it has the same meaning in intransitive verbs and is usually only used for emphasis.

- luil'ul = lu'ul = food, drink, fuel.

In intransitive roots, it denotes the patient of the causative form of the root.

- puiluv > someone who is turned into a dog.

# Modality

The second infix in a root determines modality and/or evidentiality.

| Infix | Meaning                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| k'u   | ability or possibility (can, may) |
| sa    | necessity (must)                  |

It acts like verbal mood.

```gloss
Puuv ek la'an ulk'u'ul
@puuv ek la'an ul(k'u)'ul
@dog ERG milk drink(BIL)
The dog can drink milk
```

Likewise, the infix can be used in noun as well.

- puk'uuv > someone who can be a dog.
- pusauv > someone who must be a dog (someone who is definitely a dog).

And the infix can be put together with the voices.

- puilk'uuv > someone who can be turned into a dog
