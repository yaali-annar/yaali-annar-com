## Syntax

### Alignment

Ruuk is an ergative language with a verb-last syntax.

```gloss
Kalob ušun
@kalob ušun
@dog sleep
The dog sleeps
```

The postposition "ak" is the ergative case marker.

```gloss
Kalob ak maik akkal
@kalob ak maik akkal
@dog ERG water consume
The dog drinks water
```

Modifier comes before a noun:

- šunu kalob > sleeping dog
- kakla pirih > fruit that's eaten

Modifier can also has their own parameters.

- kalob ak kakla pirih > fruit that's eaten by the dog

### Valency

All intransitive verbs in spoken loti are labile verbs (also called ergative verbs). Adding an ergative turns the verb into a causative.

```gloss
S'abar aŧub
@Ssabar aŧub
@ice melt
The ice melts
```

```gloss
Lahab ak s'abar aŧub
@lahab ak s'abar aŧub
@fire ERG ice melt
The fire melts the ice
```

Likewise, without the ergative noun, the sentence is similar to passive voice.

```gloss
Maik akkal
@maik akkal
@water consume
The water is drunk
```

Causative on transitive verb is formed by the causative postposition "gat"

```glos
Nin gat kalob ak maar akkal
@nin gat kalob ak maar akkal
@I CAU dog ERG healthy.thing eat
I feed the dog healthy things.
```

Literally "I caused the dog to eat healthy thing."

Such causative sentence is still valid without ergative noun.

```glos
Nin gat šak `iglom
@nin gat šok `iglom
@I CAU he know
I spoke about him
```

Literally "I causes (someone) to know about him."
