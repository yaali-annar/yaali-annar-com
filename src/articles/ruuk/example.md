Soon, other groups came, and they couldn’t understand each other because of their different languages. Misunderstandings grew, and war broke out among them.
So, we came down to see the destruction they had caused.
We said, "If they all spoke the same language, they wouldn’t fight. If they work together, nothing will be impossible for them."
So, we decided, "Let’s make them speak the same language, so they can understand each other."
And from that moment, their languages were united, and the fighting stopped.
The place was called Unity because it was there that we brought the languages of the world together and made peace.
