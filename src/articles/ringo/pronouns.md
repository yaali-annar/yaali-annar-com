```

## Interrogative

The interrogative pronoun "ko" is used with any noun, regardless of animacy.

- **Wenes ko?** - Who will come
- **Okases ko?** - What happened

If needed, **uro ke** (what person) or **o ke** (what thing) can be used for who and what.

The pronoun can have preposition as well, to form interrogative that would be a word in english.

**Pol ko** - Because of what > Why

```gloss
Sades lo pol ko?
@sades lo pol ko
@be.sad they.sg because.of what
Why are they sad?
```

**Kun ko** - With what > how

```gloss
Kuwires mo na riso kun ko?
@kuwires mo na riso kun ko
@cook I ACC rice with what
How do I cook rice?
```

Alternatively, **Kun manero ke** can also be used to really emphasize the method.

**Ni ko** - Of what > whose

```gloss
Gonges hundo ni ko?
@gonges hundo ni ko
@bark dog of who
Whose dog is barking?
```

The interrogative determiner "ke" is used to form other kind of interrogative.

**Loko ke** - What place > Where

```gloss
Lodes to ti loko ke?

```

**Tempo ke** - What time > When

```gloss

```

The special interrogative "bar" is used for numbers or amount. It translates to how much or how many.

```
