Here’s a fleshed-out version of the system with added details for consistency and clarity:

---

## Word Class Endings

In this Esperantido, words are categorized into three main classes: nouns, modifiers (adjectives/adverbs), and verbs. Each word class has a specific ending that distinguishes it from the others.

- **Nouns** end with **-o**.
- **Modifiers** (adjectives/adverbs) end with **-e**.
- **Verbs** end with **-es**.

### Agent Nouns (One Who X)

Unlike in Esperanto, transforming a verb or an adjective into a noun does not create a verbal noun (e.g., "speaking" or "speech"). Instead, it creates an **agent noun**, which refers to **someone or something that performs the action** or **embodies the characteristic**.

- **tolbes** (to find) → **tolbo** (finder, one who finds)
- **bule** (blue) → **bulo** (the blue one)

### Verbs from Nouns and Modifiers (To Be X / One Who is X)

Adding the verb or modifier ending to a noun or adjective creates a verb that means "to be X" or "one who is X."

- **hundo** (dog) → **hundes** (to be a dog)
- **hundo** (dog) → **hunde** (who is a dog)

This rule applies broadly to any noun or adjective to generate verbs that indicate a state of being or a quality.

- **bule** (blue) → **bules** (to be blue)
- **bule** (blue) → **bule** (who is blue)

### Abstract Verbal Nouns (The Action or Process of X)

To express an **abstract verbal noun**—a noun that refers to the **action** or **process** (such as “speaking” or “finding”)—an **infix -ab-** is added between the verb stem and the noun ending **-o**.

This applies to both verbs and adjectives, creating nouns that describe the concept of performing an action or being in a state.

- **paroles** (to speak) → **parolabo** (speech)
- **tolbes** (to find) → **tolbabo** (finding)
