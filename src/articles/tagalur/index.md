## Lexicon

Loan from non-european words can be used to replace loan-words from european language.

- Sapatos > Paduka
- Elefante > Gaja

Indonesian (or malay) are used in the following scenarios:

The Filipino word is European loan and the Indonesian is native

| Filipino | Indonesian | Tagalur |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| punta    | pergi      | pergi   |

The Filipino word is European loan and the Indonesian is non european loan

| Filipino    | Indonesian     | Tagalur |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| oras (time) | waktu (arabic) | waktu   |
| oras (hour) | jam (sanskrit) | jam     |

## Syntax

Tagalur has VSO word order.

```gloss
Kuma'en i batah ta mansan
@kuma'en i batah ta mansan
@<ACT>eat ABS child ACC apple
A child eats an apple
```

Sometimes a sentence can be VOS for the sake of clarity or aesthetics. But the verbs always come first.

## Noun Phrase

Adjective follows nouns it modifies

```gloss
A balay madakel
@a balay madakel
@ABS house big
The big house
```

Adverbs follows the adjective or the verb it modifies

```gloss
Matakebu mabilis i bata
@ma-takebu mabilis i bata
@INTR-run fast ABS child

```

### Complex Verb

A sentence can become part of speech of another sentence. For example in the sentence "I want (x) the phrase (x) can be replaced with, for example, "you tell the truth". When combined it becomes "I want you to tell the truth."

In Tagalur the embedded sentence has "ang" preceding it:

- I want (you to tell the truth): Umaw aku ta (ang sumabi aw ta tu'u)

If both of the the focus of the main sentence and the embedded sentence are the same, the focus can be dropped. For example this sentence.

```gloss
Sumuka aku nang mapergi aku da ke bunduk
@s<um>uka aku     ta-ng  ma-pergi aku ke da bunduk
@<ACT>like I(ABS) ACC-ng INTR-go I(ABS) to LOC mountain
I like (that) I go to the mountain
```

The second I can be dropped

```gloss
Sumuka aku nang mapergi aku da ke bunduk
@s<um>uka aku ta-ng ma-pergi ke da bunduk
@<ACT>like I(ABS) ACC-ng INTR-go to LOC mountain
I like to go to the mountain
```

### Modal Adverb

The equivalent of modal verbs in english are adverb in Tagalur, like other adverb they come after the verb they modify:

- Kaya (can): Kuman kaya aku titu (I can eat this)
- Dapat (must): Kuman dapat aw tana (You must eat that)
- Baka (may): Kuma baka iya tu'u (He may eat that)
