## Verbs and Adjectives

Verbs in Tagalur are conjugated on focus (voice) and aspect. The order of the conjugation are.

- Causative
- Aspect and Focus

The causative pa-, added to intrasitive turns a verb into transitive:

- atay (die) > pa'atay (kill)

The aspects are as follows.

| Aspect       | Affix  | Example  |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- |
| None         | -      | baca     |
| Perfective   | -in-   | binaca   |
| Contemplated | CV-    | babaca   |
| Progressive  | C-in-V | binabaca |

The focuses are as follows.

| Focus       | Affix | Example  |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| Stative     | ma-   | matudur  |
| Actor       | -um-  | bumaca   |
| Patient     | -(e)n | bacan    |
| Locus       | -an   | baca'an  |
| Benefactive | i-    | ibaca    |
| Instrument  | pang- | pangbaca |
| Reason      | ka-   | kabaca   |

Stative focus only applies to intransitive verbs (and predicative adjective). These verbs and adjectives can't have actor or patient focus.

Focus and Aspect are combined together in semi regular fashion. In particular, notice that -en is dropped in Perfective and Progressive.

|             | Neutral | Perfective | Contemplated | Progresive  |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Stative     | ma-     | na-        | ma-CV-       | na-CV-      |
| Actor       | -um-    | -inum-     | C-um-V-      | C-inum-V    |
| Patient     | -en     | -in-       | CV- -en      | C-in-V-     |
| Locus       | -an     | -in- -an   | CV- -an      | C-in-V- -an |
| Benefactive | i-      | i<in>-     | i-C<in>V-    | i-CV-       |
| Instrument  | paN-    | pinaN-     | pinaN-CV-    | paN-CV-     |
| Reason      | ka-     | kina-      | kina-CV-     | ka-CV-      |

### Intensifier, Comparative, and Superlative

Tagalur uses adverb for these constructs. Just like other adverb it comes after the adjective.

|             | Tagalog | Malay  | Tagalur |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| Intensifier | pinaka- | sangat | sangat  |
| Comparative | mas     | lebih  | lebi    |
| Superlative | napaka- | paling | paling  |

### Adjective and Participle

Adjectives are stative verbs, they can be used like intransitive verb.

- **Matudur a asu** > The dog sleeps
- **Maputi a balay** > The house is white

When used as attributive, it goes after the noun (or noun phrase) it modifies with the link "ya".

- **A asu ya matudur** > The sleeping dog (the dog who sleeps)
- **A balay ya maputi** > The white house (the house that is white)

This strategy can even be extended to transitive verbs.

- I taw ya tumayu ta balay > The person who build the house.
- A balay ya tayun si tau > The house that the person build.

For a lot of case, the linker "ya" can be dropped:

- A balay ya maputi = A balay maputi.
- I taw ya tumayu ta balay = I taw tumayu ta balay

### Nominalization

Verbs and adjectives may also be used as nouns simply by adding case marker on them.

- **A kanen**: something eaten, food.
  - Compare to Tagalog "ang kanin".
- **A kanan:** place where eating is happened.
  - Compare to Tagalog "ang kainan"
