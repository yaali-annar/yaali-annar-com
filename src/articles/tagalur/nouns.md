### Case Markers

Consider Tagalog case markers

|          | Common Sg | Common Pl  | Personal Sg | Personal Pl |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Direct   | ang       | ang manga  | si          | sina        |
| Indirect | nang      | nang manga | ni          | nina        |
| Oblique  | sa        | sa manga   | kay         | kina        |

Tagalur case markers has the patern of:

- Inanimate -a
- Animate: -i

Unlike in Tagalog, Animate markers are used for all humans, not just for proper nouns (names)

Plural is marked with -nga (combination of manga in common and -na in personal).

Next, the consonants for the case position are:

- Absolute: none
- Nominative: s-
- Accusarive: t-
- Oblique: k-
- Genitive: n-
- Locative: d-

Note: Accusative t- here is an innovation in Tagalur.

Combining them, the case markers of Tagalur are

|            | Common Sg | Common Pl | Personal Sg | Personal Pl |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Absolute   | a         | anga      | i           | inga        |
| Nominative | sa        | sanga     | si          | singa       |
| Accusative | ta        | tanga     | ti          | tinga       |
| Oblique    | ka        | kanga     | ki          | kinga       |
| Genitive   | na        | nanga     | ni          | ninga       |
| Locative   | da        | danga     | di          | dinga       |

The suffix -nga is a bound morpheme, it cannot stand on its own. While Tagalog can form a phrase like "ang pulang mga mansanas" in Tagalur the same phrase must be translated as "anga mansan pula" instead of \*"a pula nga mansan" (additionally this construction also violates the syntax of adjective in Tagalur).

### Roles of the Absolute

Noun in absolute case may act as nominative or accusative depending on the focus of the verb.

**Agent Focus**

```gloss
Bumaca i taw ta aklat
@bumaca i taw ta aklat
@<ACT>read ABS(NOM) person ACC book
A person reads a book
```

**Patient Focus**

```gloss
Baca'en a aklat si taw
@baca-en a aklat si taw
@read-PAT ABS(ACC) book NOM person
A book is read by a person
```

In other focus, nominative and/or accsative needs to be present.

**Location Focus**

```gloss
Baca'an a balay si taw ta aklat
@baca-an a balay si taw ta aklat
@read-PAT ABS(LOC) house NOM person ACC book
A person reads a book in a house.
```

### Adposition

Tagalur uses preposition exclusively. Locative case governs locative prepositions, by default it means "at"

```gloss
Matanah aku da lungsud madakel
@ma-tanah aku da lungsud madakel
@INTR-dwell I LOC city big
I live in a big city.
```

Other locative prepositions includes: ri (from) and ke (to)

```gloss
Natakas aku ri da kurungan
@na-takas aku ri da kurungan
@INTR.PERF-escape I from LOC prison
I escaped from a prison
```

The oblique govern most other prepositions.

```gloss
Gumawa i ina ta kanen ni untuk ki ama
@G<um>awa i ina ta kanen ni untuk ki ama
@<ACT>make ABS mother ACC food this for OBL father
Mom made this food for dad.
```
