| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1st sg     | aku       | a-ku              | ku                   | a-kin              |

From here, they're constructed with case markers, only genitive is shown for example

| 2nd Pl     | amu      | namu     |
| 3rd pl     | ida      | nida     |

### Demonstratives

Consider Tagalog demonstratives. (Regularized)

|                           | Direct (ang) | Indirect (ng) | Oblique (sa) |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Near speaker              | i-di         | ni-di         | di-ni        |
| Near speaker and listener | i-tu         | ni-tu         | di-tu        |
| Near listener             | iy-an, ya-an | niy-an        | diy-an       |
| Remote                    | iy-un, yu-un | niy-un, nu-un | du-un        |

Demonstrative determiner in Tagalur are then

|                  | Near Speaker | Far From Speaker |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Near Listener    | tu           | an               |
| Far From Listner | di           | un               |

- Taw tu, this person near us.
- Taw di, this person near me.
- Taw an, that person near you.
- Taw un, that person far away from us.

And as for the pronouns, the demonstratives can get either a- or i- suffix depending on the animacy of the noun it represents. Shown here in the absolutive.

|               | Animate | Inanimate |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Near speaker  | ini     | ani       |
| Near both     | itu     | atu       |
| Near listener | iyan    | a'an      |
| Remote        | iyun    | a'un      |

### Interogative Pronouns

The word for 'who' and 'what' Tagalur has the same root 'nu' This can be combined with the marker.

|                                         | Inanimate | Animate |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| Absolute (who, whom, where, using what) | anu       | inu     |
| Nominative (who)                        | sanu      | sinu    |
| Accusative (whom)                       | tanu      | tinu    |
| Genitive (whose)                        | nanu      | ninu    |

The 'nu' particle behave like the determiner.

- Taw nu &gt; What kind of person

The other interrogatives are:

- Panu (how)
- Pija (how many)
- Kapija (when)
- Bakit (why)

The interrogatives are not moved to the front of a sentence unlike in Tagalog:

| Tagalog                     | Tagalur               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| (Sino) ang nagluto ng kanin | Lumuto (inu) ta nasi? |
| (Ano) ang kinain mo?        | Kinuman amu (tanu)?   |
