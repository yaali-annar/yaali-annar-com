## Phonology

Na Nil follows a minimalistic phonological system. The language allows for a maximum syllable structure of **CVC** (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant), though simpler syllables like **CV** or **VC** are also possible.

### Consonants

|              | Labial | Coronal | Dorsal |
| ------------ | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| Nasal        | m      | n       | Å‹ (ng) |
| Plosive      | p      | t       | k      |
| Fricative    | f      | s       | h      |
| Approximant  |        | r/l\*   | y w    |
| Closed Vowel |        |         | i u    |
| Open Vowel   |        |         | a      |

\* **Note on /r/ and /l/**: In Na Nil, **/r/** and **/l/** are in complementary distribution. **/r/** appears in the initial position of the syllable (onset), while **/l/** appears only in the final position (coda). For instance:

- **Ra** (root-initial position, 'r' as onset)
- **Ful** (root-final position, 'l' as coda)

### Phonotactic Constraints

There are some specific constraints on consonant-vowel combinations:

- **/w/** cannot appear in a syllable when the nucleus is **/u/**. This is to avoid labial overlap, as **w** and **u** both involve rounded lips.
  - Example: **/wul/** would be disallowed, while **/wil/** is valid.
- **/y/** cannot appear in a syllable when the nucleus is **/i/**. The **y** glide and **i** vowel are too similar phonetically, and this restriction ensures clarity of pronunciation.
  - Example: **/yin/** is disallowed, while **/yun/** is valid.

### Content Words

Content words in Na Nil always end in a consonant.

- Example: **misit** ("to be an animal"), **ningil** ("to be black"), **maw** ("to move").

#### Grammatical Words

Grammatical words, including pronouns, particles, and case markers, always end in a vowel.

- Example: **u** (nominative case), **nu** (accusative case), **mi** (first-person pronoun).
