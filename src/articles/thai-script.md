# Consonants

Thai consonants in writing are divided into "High," "Medium," and "Low" classes. This classification affects the tone each consonant carries. By categorizing each consonant’s initial sound and its class, we observe certain patterns: None of the consonant initials have all three class versions.

## Aspirated and Fricatives

The following consonants have both high and low versions.

| Initial | High  | Low     |
| ------- | ----- | ------- |
| kh      | ข ฃ   | ค ฅ ฆ   |
| h       | ห     | ฮ       |
| ch      | ฉ     | ช ฌ     |
| th      | ฐ ถ   | ฑ ฒ ท ธ |
| s       | ศ ษ ส | ซ       |
| ph      | ผ     | พ ภ     |
| f       | ฝ     | ฟ       |

## Liquids

The following consonants only have low versions by themselves. However, they can be modified to form high-class sounds when written as digraphs with ห (Ho Hip).

| Initial | High  | Low |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| ng      | หง    | ง   |
| w       | หว    | ว   |
| n       | หน    | ณ น |
| m       | หม    | ม   |
| y       | หญ หย | ญ ย |
| r       | หร    | ร   |
| l       | หล    | ล ฬ |

Additionally, **อย** is classified as a Mid consonant.

## Unaspirated Stops

The following consonants are exclusively mid-class.

| Initial | Mid |
| ------- | --- |
| k       | ก   |
| c       | จ   |
| d       | ฎ ด |
| t       | ฏ ต |
| b       | บ   |
| p       | ป   |

## Historical Sound Change

The division of Thai consonants into High, Medium, and Low tone classes becomes clearer when we examine their historical pronunciation, which combined elements of Sukhothai and Sanskrit phonetics. Here’s a breakdown of the consonant sounds based on their articulation categories in Sukhothai and their original Pali or Sanskrit pronunciation:

| **Velar** | **Palatal**    | **Retroflex** | **Dental** | **Labial** |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|           |                | ฎ - /ʔɖ/      | ด - /ʔd/   | บ - /ʔb/   |
| ก - /k/   | จ - /tɕ/       | ฏ - /ʈ/       | ต - /t/    | ป - /p/    |
| ข - /kʰ/  | ฉ - /tɕʰ/      | ฐ - /ʈʰ/      | ถ - /tʰ/   | ผ - /pʰ/   |
| ค - /g/   | ช - /dʑ/       | ท - /ɖ/       | ท - /d/    | พ - /b/    |
| ฆ - /gʱ/  | ฌ - /dʑʱ/      | ฒ - /ɖʱ/      | ธ - /dʱ/   | ภ - /bʱ/   |
| ฃ - /x/   | ศ - /ɕ/        | ษ - /ʂ/       | ส - /s/    | ฝ - /f/    |
| ฅ - /ɣ/   | ซ - /z/ or /ʑ/ |               |            | ฟ - /v/    |
| ง - /ŋ/   | ญ - /ɲ/        | ณ - /ɳ/       | น - /n/    | ม - /m/    |
| ว - /w/   | ย - /j/        | ร - /r/       | ล - /l/    |            |

Both voiced stops have become aspirated stops in modern Thai. This transformation is the origin of the high and low tone distinction in many consonants.

Additionally, some consonants from Pali and Sanskrit merged in Sukhothai Thai:

- In Sukhothai, no clear distinction was made between voiced and breathy stops; for instance, both ฆ and ค were pronounced as /g/.
- Retroflex and dental consonants merged, which explains why modern Thai has four low "th" sounds, originating from /ɖ, ɖʱ, d, dʱ/.
- The three fricatives /ɕ, ʂ, and s/ merged into a single /s/ sound in modern Thai.

## Consonant Frequency

Some consonants appear more frequently than others in modern Thai, with certain historical sounds like /x/ and /ɣ/ disappearing entirely. Using a corpus such as [this one](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/Thai), we can determine the frequency of each consonant in Thai script. Here are the frequencies for initials that have multiple characters:

| **Reading** | **Frequencies**                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Low kh      | ค - 3,89% ฆ - 0,04%                        |
| Low ch      | ช - 1,86%, ฌ - < 0,01%                     |
| Low th      | ท - 4,04%, ธ - 0,82%, ฑ - 0,03%, ฒ - 0,08% |
| Low ph      | พ - 2,67%, ภ - 0,65%                       |
| High s      | ส - 3,30%, ศ - 1,27%, ษ - 0,63%            |
| High th     | ถ - 0,66%, ฐ - 0,28%                       |
| d           | ด - 3,44%, ฎ - 0,12%                       |
| t           | ต - 3,20%, ฏ - 0,06%                       |
| n           | น - 10,39%, ณ - 0,63%                      |
| l           | ล - 3,94%, ฬ - 0,03%                       |

ญ and ย are sometimes considered distinct due to ญ carrying an /n/ sound in the final position.

# Vowels

Thai has nine vowels, each with a long and short version.

| Core Sound | Short Open | Short Closed | Long Open | Long Closed |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| a          | ◌ะ, ◌      | ◌ั◌          | ◌า        | ◌า◌         |
| i          | ◌ิ         | ◌ิ◌          | ◌ี        | ◌ี◌         |
| ɯ          | ◌ึ         | ◌ึ◌          | ◌ือ       | ◌ื◌         |
| u          | ◌ุ         | ◌ุ◌          | ◌ู        | ◌ู◌         |
| e          | เ◌ะ        | เ◌็◌         | เ◌        | เ◌◌         |
| ɛ          | แ◌ะ        | แ◌็◌         | แ◌        | แ◌◌         |
| o          | โ◌ะ        | ◌◌           | โ◌        | โ◌◌         |
| ɔ          | เ◌าะ       | ◌็อ◌         | ◌อ        | ◌อ◌         |
| ɤ          | เ◌อะ       | -            | เ◌อ       | เ◌ิ◌        |

In open syllables, the inherent vowel is /a/, while in closed syllables, it is /o/.

To represent /a/ in closed syllables, ◌ั (Mai Han Akat) is used. Conversely, the structure โ◌ะ is used to write /o/ in open syllables.

Certain vowels, like /e/, /ɛ/, and /ɔ/, are inherently long. The ะ (Nom Nang) marker is needed to "close" the syllable, often implying a glottal stop. In closed syllables, ◌็ (Mai Taikhu) is used to shorten these inherently long vowels.

The symbol ◌อะ is not used for short /ɔ/ in open syllables; instead, เ◌าะ represents short /ɔ/, and เ◌า without Nom Nang signifies the sound /aw/.

## Diphthongs

The following table summarizes the main diphthongs:

| Core Sound | Short Open | Short Closed | Long Open | Long Closed |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| ia         | เ◌ียะ      | -            | เ◌ีย      | เ◌ีย◌       |
| ɯa         | เ◌ือะ      | -            | เ◌ือ      | เ◌ือ◌       |
| ua         | ◌ัวะ       | -            | ◌ัว       | ◌ว◌         |
| aw         | -          | เ◌า          | -         | ◌าว         |
| aj         | -          | ไ◌, ใ◌       | -         | ◌าย         |

As with monophthongs, Nom Nang is used to shorten diphthongs. Historically, ใ◌ represented /aɯ/ but has since shifted to /aj/.

The combination ◌ัว is not used for the sound "aw" because it would read as "-wa" in Thai.

# Tone Split

The [Proto-Tai language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Tai_language) originally had three phonemic tones, with an additional "Tone D" that sometimes appears as a fourth tone. However, Tone D only occurs in "dead" syllables, those that end with an obstruent sound (e.g., stops or fricatives).

The Thai script includes four tone markers, but only the first two markers Mai Ek and Mai Tho, are commonly used.

| Tone         | Frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Mai Ek       | 56.13%    |
| Mai Tho      | 42.92%    |
| Mai Tri      | 0.68%     |
| Mai Chattawa | 0.27%     |

Originally, Mai Ek and Mai Tho corresponded to "Low" and "High" tones, respectively. Over time, sound changes led to a tonal split based on the consonant class (Low, Mid, or High) and syllable type. This resulted in central Thai’s five tone system.

## Tone Split for Live Syllables

Live syllables (those with open or sonorant final sounds) exhibit a tonal shift based on the original Proto-Tai tone and the consonant class:

- **Original Low Tone**: Mid and High consonants retain a low tone, while Low consonants shift to falling.
- **Original Mid Tone**: Low and Mid consonants remain mid-tone, while High consonants become rising.
- **Original High Tone**: Low consonants remain high, while Mid and High consonants shift to falling.

| Syllable / Tone Mark | Low     | Mid     | High    |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Mai Ek (Low)         | falling | low     | low     |
| Live syllable (Mid)  | mid     | mid     | rising  |
| Mai Tho (High)       | high    | falling | falling |

This structure lets us rerpesent of the five tones in live syllables by using the correct combination of consonant class and tone marker:

| Sound | Low | Falling | Mid | Rising | High |
| ----- | --- | ------- | --- | ------ | ---- |
| kha   | ข่  | ค่ ข้   | ค   | ข      | ค้   |
| na    | หน่ | น่ หน้  | น   | หน     | น้   |
| ka    | ก่  | ก้      | ก   | ก๋     | ก๊   |

We can see how Mai Tri and Mai Chattawa are used with mid-class consonants to create rising and high tones, as they lack these tones otherwise.

## Tone Split for Dead Syllables

In dead syllables (those with obstruent endings), the tone split is simpler. There is no tonal distinction between Mid and High consonants, leading to only three possible tones in dead syllables:

| Syllable / Tone Mark | Low     | Mid / High |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Dead Short           | high    | low        |
| Dead Long            | falling | low        |

Thus, dead syllables have only three tones:

| Sound | Low | Falling | High |
| ----- | --- | ------- | ---- |
| khok  | ขก  |         | คก   |
| khook | โขก | โคก     |      |

In summary, the combination of consonant class, tone marker, and syllable type allows Thai to maintain a rich tonal system that emerged from the simpler Proto-Tai tones.
