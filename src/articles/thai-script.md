# Consonants

Thai consonants in writing are divided into "High," "Medium," and "Low" classes. This classification affects the tone each consonant carries. By listing each consonant’s (initial) sound and its class, we can see some trends: none of the initial sounds have all three versions.

The following are the initials with both high and low versions:

| Initial | High  | Low     |
| ------- | ----- | ------- |
| kh      | ข ฃ   | ค ฅ ฆ   |
| h       | ห     | ฮ       |
| ch      | ฉ     | ช ฌ     |
| th      | ฐ ถ   | ฑ ฒ ท ธ |
| s       | ศ ษ ส | ซ       |
| ph      | ผ     | พ ภ     |
| f       | ฝ     | ฟ       |

All of these initials are either aspirated or fricatives.

Now, let’s look at the initials with only mid versions:

| Initial | Mid |
| ------- | --- |
| k       | ก   |
| c       | จ   |
| d       | ฎ ด |
| t       | ฏ ต |
| b       | บ   |
| p       | ป   |

All mid-tone initials are stops with no aspiration.

Next, we have the initials with only low versions:

| Initial | Low |
| ------- | --- |
| ng      | ง   |
| w       | ว   |
| n       | ณ น |
| m       | ม   |
| y       | ญ ย |
| r       | ร   |
| l       | ล ฬ |

These are all liquids.

# Historical Sound Change

The division of Thai consonants into High, Medium, and Low tone classes becomes clearer when we examine their historical pronunciation, which combined elements of Sukhothai and Sanskrit phonetics. Here’s a breakdown of the consonant sounds based on their articulation categories in Sukhothai and their original Pali or Sanskrit pronunciation:

| **Velar** | **Palatal**    | **Retroflex** | **Dental** | **Labial** |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|           |                | ฎ - /ʔɖ/      | ด - /ʔd/   | บ - /ʔb/   |
| ก - /k/   | จ - /tɕ/       | ฏ - /ʈ/       | ต - /t/    | ป - /p/    |
| ข - /kʰ/  | ฉ - /tɕʰ/      | ฐ - /ʈʰ/      | ถ - /tʰ/   | ผ - /pʰ/   |
| ค - /g/   | ช - /dʑ/       | ท - /ɖ/       | ท - /d/    | พ - /b/    |
| ฆ - /gʱ/  | ฌ - /dʑʱ/      | ฒ - /ɖʱ/      | ธ - /dʱ/   | ภ - /bʱ/   |
| ฃ - /x/   | ศ - /ɕ/        | ษ - /ʂ/       | ส - /s/    | ฝ - /f/    |
| ฅ - /ɣ/   | ซ - /z/ or /ʑ/ |               |            | ฟ - /v/    |
| ง - /ŋ/   | ญ - /ɲ/        | ณ - /ɳ/       | น - /n/    | ม - /m/    |
| ว - /w/   | ย - /j/        | ร - /r/       | ล - /l/    |            |

Both voiced stops have become aspirated stops in modern Thai. This transformation is the origin of the high and low tone distinction in many consonants.

Additionally, some consonants from Pali and Sanskrit merged in Sukhothai Thai:

- In Sukhothai, no clear distinction was made between voiced and breathy stops; for instance, both ฆ and ค were pronounced as /g/.
- Retroflex and dental consonants merged, which explains why modern Thai has four low "th" sounds, originating from /ɖ, ɖʱ, d, dʱ/.
- The three fricatives /ɕ, ʂ, and s/ merged into a single /s/ sound in modern Thai.

# Vowels

Thai have nine vowels each with long and short version.

| Core Sound | Short Open | Short Closed | Long Open | Long Closed |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| a          | ◌ะ, ◌      | ◌ั◌          | ◌า        | ◌า◌         |
| i          | ◌ิ         | ◌ิ◌          | ◌ี        | ◌ี◌         |
| ɯ          | ◌ึ         | ◌ึ◌          | ◌ือ       | ◌ื◌         |
| u          | ◌ุ         | ◌ุ◌          | ◌ู        | ◌ู◌         |
| e          | เ◌ะ        | เ◌็◌         | เ◌        | เ◌◌         |
| ɛ          | แ◌ะ        | แ◌็◌         | แ◌        | แ◌◌         |
| o          | โ◌ะ        | ◌◌           | โ◌        | โ◌◌         |
| ɔ          | เ◌าะ       | ◌็อ◌         | ◌อ        | ◌อ◌         |
| ɤ          | เ◌อะ       | -            | เ◌อ       | เ◌ิ◌        |

The inherent vowel in open syllable is /a/ and in closed syllable is /o/.

To write /a/ in closed syllable ◌ั (Mai Han Akat) is used. Conversely, the construct โ◌ะ is used to write /o/ in open syllable.

Some of the vowels, such as /e ɛ ɔ/ are "inherently" long. Thus ะ (Nom Nang) is needed to "close" the syllable and the sign itself can be interpreted as a glotal stop. In closed syllable ◌็ (Mai Taikhu) is used to shorten the vowel.

Lastly \*◌อะ is not used for short /ɔ/ in open syllable. But rather, เ◌าะ is used. In particular เ◌า with out Nom Nang is /aw/.

The diphtongs are:

| Core Sound | Short Open | Short Closed | Long Open | Long Closed |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| ia         | เ◌ียะ      | -            | เ◌ีย      | เ◌ีย◌       |
| ɯa         | เ◌ือะ      | -            | เ◌ือ      | เ◌ือ◌       |
| ua         | ◌ัวะ       | -            | ◌ัว       | ◌ว◌         |
| aw         | -          | เ◌า          | -         | ◌าว         |
| aj         | -          | ไ◌, ใ◌       | -         | ◌าย         |

Like in monophtongs, Nom Nang is used to shorten a diphtong. ใ◌ is historically /aɯ/ But has been turned into aj.

Note how the construct ◌ัว is not used for "aw", because that would read "-wa".

# Consonant Frequency

Some consonants appear more frequently than others in modern Thai, with certain historical sounds like /x/ and /ɣ/ disappearing entirely. Using a corpus such as [this one](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/Thai), we can determine the frequency of each consonant in Thai script. Here are the frequencies for initials that have multiple characters:

| **Reading** | **Frequencies**                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Low kh      | ค - 4.03%, ฆ - 0.04%                       |
| Low ch      | ช - 1.87%, ฌ - < 0.01%                     |
| Low th      | ท - 4.05%, ธ - 0.82%, ฑ - 0.03%, ฒ - 0.07% |
| Low ph      | พ - 2.69%, ภ - 0.63%                       |
| High s      | ส - 3.30%, ศ - 1.28%, ษ - 0.62%            |
| High th     | ถ - 0.63%, ฐ - 0.28%                       |
| d           | ด - 3.40%, ฎ - 0.08%                       |
| t           | ต - 3.23%, ฏ - 0.06%                       |
| n           | น - 10.25%, ณ - 0.62%                      |
| l           | ล - 3.90%, ฬ - 0.03%                       |

Note that ญ and ย are sometimes considered distinct due to ญ carrying an /n/ sound in the final position.

# Tone Split

The [Proto-Tai language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Tai_language) originally had three phonemic tones. While Tone D is sometimes classified as a fourth tone, it only occurs in "dead" syllables, which are syllables ending with an obstruent sound (e.g., stops or fricatives).

The Thai script includes four tone markers, but in modern usage, only the first two tones, Mai Ek and Mai Tho, are commonly used.

| Tone         | Frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Mai Ek       | 56.31%    |
| Mai Tho      | 42.72%    |
| Mai Tri      | 0.69%     |
| Mai Chattawa | 0.28%     |

Originally, Mai Ek and Mai Tho corresponded to "Low" and "High" tones, respectively. Over time, sound changes led to a tonal split based on the consonant class (Low, Mid, or High) and syllable type. This resulted in modern Thai’s nuanced tone system.

For live syllables (those with open or sonorant final sounds):

- In the original mid tone, Low and Mid initials remain mid, while High initials become rising.
- In the original low tone, Mid and High consonants retain the low tone, while Low consonants become falling.
- In the original high tone, Low consonants stay high, while Mid and High consonants shift to falling.

| Syllable / Tone Mark | Low     | Mid     | High    |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Mai Ek (Low)         | falling | low     | low     |
| Live syllable (Mid)  | mid     | mid     | rising  |
| Mai Tho (High)       | high    | falling | falling |

Examples:

| Syllable / Tone Mark | Low          | Mid        | High       |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Mai Ek (Low)         | พี่ - phì    | ไก่ - kài  | ไข่ - khài |
| Live syllable (Mid)  | ควาย - khway | กา - kaa   | ขา - khǎa  |
| Mai Tho (High)       | ม้า - máa    | เก้า - kâu | ฆ่า - khâa |

For dead syllables (those with obstruent endings), the tone split is simpler, as there is no differentiation between Mid and High initials:

| Syllable / Tone Mark | Low     | Mid / High |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Dead Short           | high    | low        |
| Dead Long            | falling | low        |

Examples:

| Syllable / Tone Mark | Low         | Mid / High  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Dead Short           | นก - nók    | ตก - tòk    |
| Dead Long            | นอก - naôok | ตอก - taòok |
